<!-- The user should be able to search for a beer using its name.

- The page should have a form on it that is using the submit event.

- The results of the search should be displayed in a list. Only the name of the beers should be in this list.

- The list can contain a maximum of 10 results. If there are more than 10 beers in the results, the list should be paginated.

- If you click on a beer in the list, you should go to the `Beer Info Page`. -->
